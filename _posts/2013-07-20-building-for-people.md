Personally, I find one of the most fundamental stages of starting any project is getting a reality check – some real usage feedback and data. It’s not enough for us developers to decide alone as to what our products should have; compared to our average user, we often have very different understandings of the web.

Enter the lean cycle. The lean cycle is about incorporating real user data, and building according to that. Gone are the days where big corps decide the future of a product. The product specs should be defined by the product users!

How do you start getting this data?

- Through friends, family and colleagues. Showing your product in person to people and explain what you do will give you some straight up, honest, and potentially career-saving advice on your product.
- Showcasing online – posting a demo on websites like Hackernews, reddit or even on popular blogs will get a large number of anonymous people using your system. Unlike with family and friends, that these people won’t have you explaining what every part of the website does. You’ll get much more realistic feedback on User Experience (UX). However, be prepared for a tsunami or trolling.
- Trial run. Run a beta-phased program within a closed environment and hold close personal contact with people running the trial. This allows users to get a real feel for your platform, and give detailed feedback on what you can do do improve. You can’t really get this far without first having a product though – so build the bare minimum.
- A/B testing is a post-launch data-driven way to see how users like feature changes. It’s named A/B testing as you have two different versions of the website running concurrently. You will then show page A to some people, and page B to others. By tracking data of the users (interaction, time spent on website, and average time on page), you can see which of the two versions are preferred between the general userbase, and can decide which one to make an addition. A/B testing is also used to see what features users use the most, and improve those accordingly.

We’ve been in discussions with the Electrical and Electronic and Chemistry Departments at Imperial, about running trials of the platform starting in October 2013. Other departments have also expressed an interest. By running TeachBack in within our own campus, we’ll be able to make sure all of the bugs and problems are ironed out before distributing further afield.
