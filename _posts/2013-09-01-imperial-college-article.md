As part of an article for Imperial College on TeachBack, Thomas was interviewed by Lucy Handford.

“As Electrical and Electronic Engineering students we spend a lot time in the lab working closely with the teaching assistants. We realised that a programme where students could quickly and easily submit feedback on teaching assistants after each lab experiment could help improve the student experience. The idea of TeachBack was born.

Dario and I set about building a rough prototype to use in our Department. We constructed a simple programme to begin with but the interface and ease of use proved a hit with students. Since then staff from other departments have also contacted us to enquire about the system.

When we heard about the competition it came at a tricky time, right in the middle of the exam period, but we couldn’t turn down the potential to win funding for our project!

After recording our video straight after an exam we used our network of contacts to gather support in time for the competition deadline. Doug Hunt the former Deputy President (Education) and this year’s Editor of Felix, Tim Arbabzadah helped promote our campaign through Imperial College Union and friends encouraged people to vote through Facebook and Twitter. Seeing 150 votes come in just over twenty-four hours was a real relief, and the feedback we were getting was that people really believed in our idea.

Our next challenge is to build the TeachBack platform so that it can integrate with other College systems. We also want to design the system in a way which potentially could see other universities using it.”
