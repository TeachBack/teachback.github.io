On the last Tuesday last month, JISC held their first networking event in one of the most innovative centres in London; Google Campus. Both of us took the day off work and headed our way for the event.

The day, which was the first such event over the summer, was aimed at introducing staff, tutors, and other students to one another. With time both to meet and greet, as well as smaller discussion groups, the day was laid out to meet people outside the (overused) mailing list to talk about everything.

The advantage of being part of a competition such as the Summer of Innovation, is the access to resources. We both left the day not only with answered questions, but with a handful of contacts to help us overcome our main blocker; User Authentication. As TeachBack relies on being able to authenticate a user, as well as extract course information from the user, we had to find a way to integrate with all colleges who plan to use TeachBack. During the day, we got feedback on how to implement a such system, as well as example projects who have a similarly styled authentication system.

A lot of good came out of the day – we’re glad we could make it, and hope to be able to make it to Greenwich!
