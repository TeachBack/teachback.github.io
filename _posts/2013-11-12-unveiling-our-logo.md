I have been meaning to create a logo for TeachBack– both for the JISC Showcase, and going forwards. Coming from the startup community, your logo is your brand identity when dropped in to the ‘pool’ of any given website, which I see frequently (take for example [Seedcamp’s](http://seedcamp.com/companies/) companies). But it also gives us a visual identity to work from: something which guides the shapes and colours of our web app.

Graphic design is something I’d always been scared by, and I’m not entirely sure why. As a photographer, I love Lightroom and had used Photoshop before when preparing images for magazine printing. In my head there was a wall between the skills we possess, and that required to design a logo. Working with [Ben Miles](http://www.benmil.es) was great. I went from knowing nothing about Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop, to feeling confident in at least basic tasks within a couple of hours. You can really get far with just a rudimentary knowledge of Illustrator, and you will have something in no time!

Colours are also interesting– Ben introduced us to [colorlovers.com](http://www.colourlovers.com), and from there we could browse the many hundreds of free colour palettes on offer. We selected a combination of brown and green shades. I am advised that we are quite brave to have chosen a brown palette, but we are excited to see what it brings!

The process of logo design taught me that graphic design work does not need to be the ‘black magic’ which many of us treat it as!
